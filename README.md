# Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-Analysis
Analysis on greenhouse gases data from Government website and use of ML to develop a model for predicting future greenhouse gases' emissions.

The Greenhouse Emission Analysis project will collect information on greenhouse gas emissions annually from facilities across Canada. Environment and Climate Change Canada must receive reports from plants that generate 10 kilotons or more of GHGs annually in carbon dioxide equivalent (eq.) units.
Emissions data will be available by gas (in tons and tons of CO2) for each site and each year of data collected. The GHGs included are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

Analysis of greenhouse gas emissions forecasts Canada's greenhouse gas emissions (mostly CO2), which can then be divided into province-specific categories. This can assist in gaining insight into the rate of growth of greenhouse emissions as well as the industries that are most responsible for this growth.

It can be known about the industries which causes more CO2 emission.
Planning on which steps to take to reduce the carbon emission from any particular industry.
From the predictions, it will be more feasible for us to create an action plan to control the green house gas emissions for an industry or a province.
Using this model, new predictions can always be made by feeding new or latest data, so in future it is also useful to know greenhouse gas emissions.

Estimated volume of database will be 13000 records consisting of information about industries emitting greenhouse gases and different types of gases. All data is structured and stored in tabular format in the database.
